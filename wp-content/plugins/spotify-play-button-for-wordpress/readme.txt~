Spotify Play Button can easily be added to post or page for instant play of album, playlist or song.

Oh, and it has an admin page in WordPress too.

== Description ==

Spotify Play Button easily added to post or page for instant play of album, playlist or song.

Album example: [spotifyplaybutton play="spotify:album:7JggdVIipgSShK1uk7N1hP"]

Playlist example: [spotifyplaybutton play="spotify:user:jonk:playlist:2CFFIqapZ8VqBcB0YTapGF"]

Song example: [spotifyplaybutton play="spotify:track:2qntSA2cwerjTduHPuKnW5"]

Simply right click on album, playlist or song in Spotify and click "Copy Spotify URI" and use that as the value for "play".

You can set the style for your Spotify Play Buttons on the "Spotify Play Button Settings" page under the "Settings" menu (http://YOURBLOG/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=spotifyplaybutton_settings).

You can also add attributes to customize a single Spotify Play Button:
1. view
2. size
3. sizetype
4. type
All of these will override the settings in "Spotify Play Button Settings" for the Spotify Play Button and they are all optional.

Example:
[spotifyplaybutton play="spotify:album:7JggdVIipgSShK1uk7N1hP" view="coverart" size="500" sizetype="width" theme="white"]
